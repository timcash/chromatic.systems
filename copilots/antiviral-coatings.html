                Eficacy of antimicrobial and anti-viral coated air filters to prevent the spread of airborne pathogens

                The risk of respiratory infection is increased in people using public transport and was noted to be sixfold higher in people who had used a tram or bus within 5 days of the onset of symptoms 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Investigation of London Underground Oyster card data demonstrated a signifcant correlation between higher rates of infuenza-like illnesses in people with increased underground usage and/or those who incur more contact while travelling in London boroughs 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The risk of developing COVID-19 is also increased with greater public transport use by several studies
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In particular, a recent case study demonstrated that among the 68 passengers who travelled on a bus with one infected individual, 24 became infected with SARS-CoV2. Tis is compared to none who travelled on a separate bus 4 . Both buses had air conditioning on a recycling mode, and the pattern of spread supported a role for airborne transmission, as the risk of COVID-19 was not signifcantly associated with distance from the index case.
