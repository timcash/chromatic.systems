            Frequently Asked Questions Conservation Innovation Grants (National
            Component) Federal Fiscal Year 2019 1 
            <ul>
<li>1. What is the email, phone
    and address we should use for ongoing questions?
    nrcscig@wdc.usda.gov</li>
            
             <li>
                2. If we received a CIG award in the past, do
                we need to register for new DUNS and SAMS numbers? All CIG
                applicants are required to be registered in the System for Award
                Management, and provide a valid unique entity identifier (Data
                Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number before submitting an
                application. A CIG applicant who received an award in the past need
                not request a new DUNS number or SAMS registration before applying
                for another CIG award, but all applicants are obligated to ensure
                their DUNS number and SAMS registration is current. For further
                Information on SAM registration and applying for a DUNS number,
                please refer to the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NFO) -- Section
                IV(B).
            </li> 
            <li>
                
                3. Do DUNS and Sam numbers follow the farm or the person? The
               primary applicant can be either an individual or an entity. Each
               group submitting a proposal will need to decide who they want the
               primary applicant to be and use the corresponding DUNS and Sam
               number to apply. 
            </li> 
            4. Could you please distinguish between the three
            CIG competitions currently available (State CIG, National CIG, and
            On-Farm Trials)? The CIG program has three components, each of which
            has a separate competition: 1. State CIG competitions (each
            participating state holds their own competition), 2. National CIG
            competition, and 3. On-Farm Conservation Innovation Trials. The
            State and National CIG competitions are similar, but the State
            competitions offer smaller awards and their own set of funding
            priorities. On-Farm Trials is a new CIG component that is focused on
            more widespread adoption of conservation innovations that are known
            to have a positive conservation impact. OnFarm Trials explicitly
            requires that incentive payments be paid to ag producers who
            participate by implementing innovations on their land. The CIG State
            and National competitions target technologies not necessarily fully
            developed whereas On-Farm Trials target projects that have been
            proven effective and are poised for widescale adoption. 5. Are there
            NRCS staff who can offer advice on proposal writing? NRCS does not
            provide assistance with proposal writing. CIG staff are available to
            answer questions related to the contents of the CIG Notice of
            Funding Opportunity (NFO). 6. Can a CIG grant be awarded to work
            with a producer who has previously worked with another successful
            CIG awardee? Frequently Asked Questions Conservation Innovation
            Grants (National Component) Federal Fiscal Year 2019 2 Yes. 7. What
            is the historical percentage of applications that receive CIG funds?
            The percentage varies from year to year on the basis of demand
            (total applications received) and total funding availability. In
            2018, $10 million in funding was made available, 144 applications
            were received, and 22 grants were awarded. 8. CIG also has state
            specific programs. Where can I find out if there will be state-level
            funding available in my state? See your state’s NRCS website
            (accessible here) for information on state-level funding
            availability for CIG. 9. Are there any reasons an applicant would
            apply to a state CIG competition versus the national competition,
            other than financial limits? There is often less competition in the
            state competition, with many fewer applications submitted. In
            addition, States may use different funding priorities than the
            national competition, so in some cases an entity may not be able to
            apply for the national competition but could apply to a state that
            is using relevant funding priorities. 10. Can a single organization
            be awarded funds for more than one project in a single year? There
            is no prohibition on a single entity being awarded more than one
            grant in a single year. 11. Can one applicant apply to multiple CIG
            competitions (including the National CIG Classic competition, a
            State-based CIG competition and On-Farm trials) in the same year?
            Yes, one applicant can apply to more than one CIG competition if the
            applications they are submitting are for different projects. 12.
            Could a project that involves research on one farm be competitive?
            Is there a minimum acreage amount required to be selected? On-farm
            research is allowable in CIG. See the NFO for a definition of
            “on-farm research.” There is no minimum acreage amount required. 13.
            If you get multiple applications from the same geographic area, are
            you likely to only choose one of them? Multiple applications may be
            selected from the same geographical area. Geographic diversity is
            one criterion NRCS may consider in making final award selections.
            14. Is there any limit or preference on geographic scope? Are
            multi-state projects desirable? There is no set limit on geographic
            scope. As stated in evaluation criteria in the Notice of Funding
            Announcement, projects that have the potential to transfer their
            approach or technology to a broader audience or to other geographic
            areas or agricultural sectors will receive a higher point ranking
            and therefore be more competitive. Frequently Asked Questions
            Conservation Innovation Grants (National Component) Federal Fiscal
            Year 2019 3 15. If a proposal addresses more than one CIG priority,
            does that make it more competitive? Addressing more than one
            priority neither increases nor lessens the competitiveness of a
            proposal. All proposals must identify a primary priority that will
            be used in assigning applications to peer review panels. 16. What
            would meet the requirement for inclusion of EQIP eligible producers?
            The CIG statute states that all CIG projects must involve EQIP
            eligible producers. The extent to which projects involve EQIP
            eligible producers is taken into consideration as part of the
            application evaluation criteria. 17. Must the EQIP-eligible
            producers who are part of the project be recruited and identified at
            the time of application? It is not necessary to recruit and identify
            all of the intended EQIP eligible producers that will be
            participating in a project at the time of application. Applications
            must, however, describe the extent of involvement of EQIP-eligible
            producers in the project. In addition, if matching funds are to be
            provided by producers, those producers and matching fund amounts
            must be identified at the time of application. 18. Can a proposal
            include some producers that are EQIP-eligible, and some that are NOT
            EQIP-eligible? If YES, then will there be any limitations on
            activities we can conduct on non-EQIP eligible farms? The NFO
            provides detailed information related to this question. While
            EQIP-eligible producers must be involved in all CIG projects, not
            all producers involved in project must be EQIP-eligible. Any CIG
            payments made to producers as part of a project must go to
            EQIP-eligible producers. 19. Is there a limit on the number of
            letters of support that can be included within the applications? No.
            Letters of support for the project from individuals or entities that
            are not project partners may be submitted and should be placed at
            the very end of the application package. 20. Can an entity be
            awarded both a national and state-level CIG? Yes, if they are for
            different projects. 21. Can state-level CIG awards that we have
            received for the project count as matching funds? No. Federal funds
            cannot be used as matching funding for CIG projects. 22. Are Federal
            collaborators (e.g., a USGS scientist) allowed to be included in
            applications if the submitting entity is a state university? Yes.
            However, CIG funding cannot be used to support salary, benefits, or
            travel of a Frequently Asked Questions Conservation Innovation
            Grants (National Component) Federal Fiscal Year 2019 4 Federal
            employee. In addition, Federal salaries cannot be used as in-kind
            matching funds for the CIG project. 23. How does partnership in the
            CIG application work? Does only one team member apply? For instance,
            should the proposal mention that one team is developing a tool and
            another is doing the dissemination/education/outreach portion? Each
            application must be submitted by a single individual or entity.
            Applications may have multiple components, with different partners
            leading execution of those components. In these cases, most
            applicants choose to have the partners serve as subcontractors. 24.
            How is funding allocated across the priority areas? There is no set
            amount of funding dedicated to each priority area. 25. Will
            pollinator habitat continue to be a priority in future years?
            National CIG priorities are selected by the NRCS Chief each year. It
            is unlikely that priorities that were selected this year will be
            chosen again in the following year. 26. If a portion of CIG funds
            are used for development of a tool that was already in development
            prior to receiving the grant, does the tool still need to be free
            for all to use? NRCS does not prohibit the development of tools that
            are ultimately commercialized and sold to farmers, ranchers or
            forest landowners. 27. The mandatory travel amount is $3,000. Do we
            budget that per staff included in the project or just the primary
            project director? The $3,000 travel amount should be budgeted per
            project, not per staff member. This travel funding is designated for
            each project to send up to two contacts to a CIG orientation meeting
            and one additional conference or similar event. Any additional
            travel required for completion of the project must be considered
            additional to this $3,000. 28. Is the purchase of new equipment that
            is not fixed allowed? Yes, purchase of unfixed equipment is
            permitted consistent with the definitions and provisions of 2 CFR
            200. Also, please refer to the NFO Section IV (6) 7 – Funding
            Restrictions. 29. Can equipment serve as matching funding? Yes.
            Matching funds may be committed by the applicant, project partners,
            or both, and can be a combination of cash and in-kind contributions.
            Examples of in-kind contributions include work done by unpaid
            volunteers and donations of supplies, facilities, or equipment.
            Please refer to the NFO Section 4(8). 30. Can 50% of the matching
            funds be provided by other grants? Yes, as long as the matching
            funds are documented in line with the requirements of the Frequently
            Asked Questions Conservation Innovation Grants (National Component)
            Federal Fiscal Year 2019 5 NFO, are not federal funds, are committed
            at the time of application, and are not being used as match on
            another Federal grant. 31. Are matching funds for a project only
            relevant if they are spent after the grant agreement is signed, or
            can an applicant count related expenditures leading up to the
            agreement being finalized? Costs incurred prior to the effective
            date of the grant (preaward costs) may not be reimbursed, nor may
            matching funds expended prior to the effective date of the grant be
            counted as matching funds for the project. Please see the NFO
            Section IV(6) – Funding Restrictions. 32. Does the match need to be
            secured at the time of application? How should an applicant address
            the match requirement if specific producers involved in the project
            will not be identified until after proposal submission? All matching
            funds for CIG projects must be committed at the time of application.
            If matching funds are to be provided by producers, those producers
            and matching fund amounts must be identified at the time of
            application. 33. Can overhead costs be reimbursed or used as match?
            Yes. Please refer to section IV.B.7 of the Notice of Funding
            Opportunity to learn more about indirect costs. 34. Are there
            guidelines for how to determine the value for in-kind contributions
            cost? The value of applicant contributions to the project is
            established according to federal cost principles. Applicants should
            refer to §2 CFR 200.306 for additional guidance on matching funds,
            in-kind contributions, and allowable costs. 35. The Notice of
            Funding Opportunity states that an applicant can voluntarily reduce
            or waive indirect cost rate recovery as part of the required match.
            If an applicant decides to do this, can applicant decide what
            percent to waive? Yes. An applicant can claim unrecovered indirect
            costs as part of their match and they can choose what percentage of
            their indirect costs that they want to contribute to match instead
            of claim for reimbursement. However, applicants cannot decide the
            rate at which they value their indirect costs. Eligibility to
            recover indirect cost and the rate at which indirect costs can be
            claimed is described in section IV.B.7 of the Notice of Funding
            Opportunity. 36. Is a list of previous awardees available? A list of
            previous National awardees can be found on the CIG webpage using the
            project search tool. Multimedia stories on the 2017 and 2018
            grantees can also be found on the CIG webpage. 37. How are proposal
            reviewers chosen? Are they typically from within NRCS or other
            agencies Frequently Asked Questions Conservation Innovation Grants
            (National Component) Federal Fiscal Year 2019 6 or universities?
            Proposal reviewers are usually a mix of NRCS technical experts,
            staff from other Federal agencies, and even non-Federal technical
            experts. 38. Do we have to start the project on the date the grant
            agreement is signed? If our project is designed around growing
            years, starting in September is difficult. CIG projects begin on the
            date of final execution of the grant agreement. No cost extensions
            have been used in the past when growing year conflicts have made it
            difficult for an entity to complete their project within the given
            timeframe. 39. Will NRCS negotiate CIG awards if the amount
            requested is deemed too high? NRCS reserves the right to negotiate
            CIG award amounts. Negotiations are considered on a case-by-case
            basis. 40. Roughly how long does it take from submission date to
            receiving grant money? Applicants should plan their project with a
            projected start date of January 2, 2020. Once a grant agreement is
            signed by NRCS and the awardee, grant funding is provided on a
            reimbursable basis, though advances are allowed. Grantees may begin
            expending grant funding upon execution of their grant agreement. 41.
            How do we get feedback on CIG applications previously submitted in
            2018? Peer panel feedback is provided to each CIG applicant not
            selected for an award. Please email nrcscig@wdc.usda.gov if you have
            not received feedback from a proposal submitted in 2018.
