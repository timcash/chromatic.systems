                <h1>Biologically intensive agriculture</h1>  A prolific and sustainable method for growing food which has its roots in the history of humankind: it was practiced 5000 years ago in Ethiopia, 4000 years ago in China, Japan and Korea, 2000 years ago in Greece, and 1000 years ago in the Mayan culture. In 2009 it was the method featured in the primary case study in the UNEP-UNCTAD report Organic Agriculture and Food Security in Africa, with positive results. Using Biointensive agriculture in its modern, scientifically proven form, at intermediate-level yields, with a reasonable buildup of soil quality and farmer skill, on approximately 4000 square feet (317.6 square meters) per person it is possible to raise:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A complete vegan diet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Carbonaceous and nitrogenous compost materials necessary to maintain fertile soil
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A modest income
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Per pound of food produced, as compared with conventional mechanized agriculture, the Biointensive method has the capacity to use:
                <ul>
                    <li>66% less water</li>
                    <li>50-100% less purchased nutrients</li>
                    <li>94-99% less energy in all forms</li>
                    <li>Substantially increased yields</li>
                    <li>100% increase in soil fertility! </li>
                </ul>
                The Biointensive method is organic, sustainable, low-input, high-yield agriculture, and is already being implemented by small farmers in 141 countries around the world. It truly has the potential to combat hunger and establish food security, and to be the “greener revolution” this planet needs.
